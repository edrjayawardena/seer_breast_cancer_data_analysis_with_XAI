# seer_breast_cancer_data_analysis_with_XAI
This project aims to analyze the SEER breast cancer dataset to identify factors influencing patient survival. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) used to enhance the interpretability of the models.

T Stage	Classification of the size and extent of the primary tumor.
N Stage	Classification of regional lymph node involvement.
6th Stage	Classification related to cancer staging.
Grade	Differentiation of the tumor cells.
A Stage	Additional stage classification.
Tumor Size	Size of the tumor in centimeters.
Estrogen Status	Hormone receptor status (positive/negative).
Progesterone Status	Hormone receptor status (positive/negative).
Regional Node Examined	Number of lymph nodes examined.
